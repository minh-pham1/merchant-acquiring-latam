# Main Page APIs

Welcome to our API support documentation!

For a brief introduction on how to use the APIS, visit our [introduction](?path=docs/english/banworks/APIs-Introduction.md).

This page describes the REST APIs and resources provided by Fiserv.

Our systems are reliable with great performance and elasticity.

As business leaders in the payments space, APIs will provide an opportunity for developers to leverage our payments ecosystem and extensive infrastructure.

Our APIs have URI paths and use native HTTP authentication, providing secure access to information.

Make HTTP requests using GET and POST methods, receive responses in JSON format.

This allows developers to use any programming language to access our APIs, securely integrate and build many different applications.

To access the APIs, start by acquiring an [Access Token](../api/?type=post&path=/token/)
